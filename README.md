# All-In Emerald Beta

Thank you for your interest in All-In Emerald
First, a disclaimer. I can not help you find a ROM for your base file for Pokémon Emerald. I will acknowledge that they are not hard to find, but for the sake of being a good boy, I will make the assumption that you are using a legally obtained version of Pokemon Emerald.
You will need:
 
- A clean version of the Pokémon Emerald ROM. the name should be "1986 - Pokemon Emerald (U)(TrashMan).gba"
- A Patcher of some kind. On mobile, I'm using UniPatcher and it has worked really well for me.
- The latest version of the All- In Emerald patch.

When I'm ready to distribute the first test patch (which I think will be 0.1.0) I will post a GitHub link in Releases, where you will be able to download the patch file.
Then you'll go into your patcher and follow the prompts

Neat thing: UniPatcher allows you to select a file and overwrite the current one with a new one.
PLEASE NOTE You WILL NOT want to have the version number be part of your output file name, or your emulator will want to have a new save for it.
If we're debugging something very early in the game, or something that has to do with starting a new game, that would be alright, but as we're going through this, it would be easiest if you did not have to start a new game every time we made a new patch.
Once you have a patched ROM, you can play it! Woohoo!
