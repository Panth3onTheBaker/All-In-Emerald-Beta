In all proceeding entries, the major patches (0.x.0) include:
- Updated wild encounter tables
- New areas to explore
- Updated Trainers
- Updated Trainers and Gym Leaders
- Added NPCs where noted for obtaining additional items/Pokemon

Minor patches may include new additions to areas, additional events, more NPCs, and more as noted.

0.1.0 Game Start to Rustboro
- System upgrades, as per the README
- Added Route 101 Meadow
- Added Oldale Forest Entry
- Added Petalburg Meadow
- Added Options Man in Oldale Town
  - Options Man currently only turns on or off Party EXP Share, but once I figure it out, he will also enable:
    - Forgettable HMs
    - All battles are Double Battles
    - More as I think of it/is requested and I figure it out

0.1.1 Minor Adjustments
- Roxanne now correctly gives you the Tera orb after defeating her.
- Route 101 Meadow > Route 101 had an NPC that was popping in, but that has been fixed now.
- Route 104 > Rustboro City had an item ball that was popping in, and is now a hidden item
- Oldale Forest 1F is now designed, but does not yet have encounters. In testing it on my own, it does not even attempt to run encounters (which is fine for now).
  - I would not recommend trying to go into Oldale Forest 2F. The warp in, but there is no way out. I did not think it would warp in without a target, but I was WRONG.
